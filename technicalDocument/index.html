            <header>Forms</header>
            <article>
                <p>Django provides a rich framework to facilitate the creation of forms and the manipulation of form data.</p>
                <p>We already know what we want our HTML form to look like. Our starting point for it in Django is this:</p>
                <code>from django import forms
                    class NameForm(forms.Form):
                        your_name = forms.CharField(label='Your name', max_length=100)</code>
                <p>The whole form, when rendered for the first time, will look like:</p>
                <code><label for="your_name">Your name: </label>
                    <input id="your_name" type="text" name="your_name" maxlength="100" required></code>
                <p>We don’t need to do much in our name.html template:</p>
                <code><form action="/your-name/" method="post">
                    {% csrf_token %}
                    {{ form }}
                    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
                </form>
                </code>
                </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Security">
            <header>Security</header>
            <article>
                <p>Security is a topic of paramount importance in the development of Web applications and Django provides multiple protection tools and mechanisms:</p>
                <p>Setting X-Frame-Options for all responses</p>
                <code>MIDDLEWARE = [
                    ...
                    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
                    ...
                ]</code>
                <p>To set the X-Frame-Options header on a per view basis, Django provides these decorators:</p>
                <code>@xframe_options_deny
                    def view_one(request):
                        return HttpResponse("I won't display in any frame!")
                    
                    @xframe_options_sameorigin
                    def view_two(request):
                        return HttpResponse("Display in a frame if it's from the same origin as me.")</code>
            </article>

                <p>HThere are a variety of techniques and tools that can help get your code running more efficiently - faster, and using fewer system resources.</p>
                <p>There are other trade-offs to bear in mind. Your own time is a valuable resource, more precious than CPU time. Some improvements might be too difficult to be worth implementing, or might affect the portability or maintainability of the code. Not all performance improvements are worth the effort.</p>
                <p>So, you need to know what performance improvements you are aiming for, and you also need to know that you have a good reason for aiming in that direction.</p>
