                    Freddie used to say: "I like people to go away from a Queen show feeling fully entertained, having had a good time. 
                    I think Queen songs are pure escapism, like going to see a good film - after that, they can go away and say that was great, and go back to their problems. 
                    I don't want to change the world with our music."</br>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"When we lost Freddie, we not only lost a great personality, a man with a great sense of humour, a true showman, but we lost probably the best. The best virtuoso rock 'n' roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in any style. He could change his style from line to line and, God, that's an art. And he was brilliant at it."</p>
